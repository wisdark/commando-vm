## Pre-Install Procedures
**You MUST disable Windows Defender for a smooth install**. The best way to accomplish this is through Group Policy.

In Windows versions 1909 and higher, Tamper Protection was added.
**Tamper Protection must be disabled first, otherwise Group Policy settings are ignored.**

1. Open Windows Security (type `Windows Security` in the search box)
1. Virus & threat protection > Virus & threat protection settings > Manage settings
1. Switch `Tamper Protection` to `Off` 
> It is not necessary to change any other setting (`Real Time Protection`, etc.)

> **Important!** Tamper Protection must be disabled before changing Group Policy settings.

To permanently disable Real Time Protection:

1. Make sure you disabled Tamper Protection
1. Open Local Group Policy Editor (type `gpedit` in the search box)
1. Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus > Real-time Protection
1. Enable `Turn off real-time protection`
1. **Reboot**
> Make sure to **reboot** before making the next change

To permanently disable Microsoft Defender:

1. Make sure you rebooted your machine
1. Open Local Group Policy Editor (type `gpedit` in the search box)
1. Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus
1. Enable `Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus`
1. **Reboot**
